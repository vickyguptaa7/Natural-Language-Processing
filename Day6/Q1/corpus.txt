The cat sat on the mat.
She opened the door and let the dog in.
Birds chirped in the trees.
The sun set behind the mountains.
He walked along the beach and listened to the waves.
Children played in the park.
She cooked dinner in the kitchen.
The rain pattered against the window.
The old house creaked in the wind.
He read a book by the fireplace.
